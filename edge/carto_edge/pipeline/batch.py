"""Batching and the ingest stage of edge-gateway (spec 5.4 step 7, 8.1 cursor checkpointing,
8.5; plan M1 wave 2, D1).

:class:`BatchAccumulator` collects the canonical events of one source into
:class:`~carto_schema.ingest.IngestBatch` envelopes of at most ``max_events`` events and
``max_bytes`` of JSON (spec 8.5: 5,000 events or 5 MB). The size is tracked as the sum of each
event's UTF-8 JSON length plus one separator byte, plus :data:`ENVELOPE_BYTES` for the envelope
fields, so a sealed batch's JSON never exceeds the cap; only a single event larger than the cap
on its own travels alone in an oversized batch (an event is never split or dropped for size).
When adding an event would exceed either limit, the pending batch is sealed and returned and the
event starts the next one.

:class:`Ingestor` is the :class:`~carto_edge.pipeline.ingestor.IngestorLike` the receivers and
the poll scheduler hand records to. Per call: every record goes through
``runtime.pipeline.process`` (outside the ingestor lock; the pipeline has its own), the reveal
vault entries of all results are written in one ``runtime.write_vault_entries`` call (before any
of their events can reach the buffer, so a forwarded token always has its vault row), and then,
under the ingestor lock, events join their source's accumulator, sealed batches are appended to
the :class:`~carto_edge.pipeline.buffer.DiskBuffer`, and only after a successful append is the
source's cursor committed to the :class:`~carto_edge.state.CursorStore`.

The cursor rule (spec 8.1, "a cursor is committed only after the batch is durably in the disk
buffer"): per source the ingestor keeps a *candidate*, the latest ``commit_cursor`` among the
records whose events are pending or durable (records are placed in order, so every record before
the candidate has been placed). When ``add`` seals a batch, the candidate as it stood before the
current record (whose event now starts the next batch) is committed after the append; when a
flush seals the partial batch, the current candidate is committed. A source with nothing pending
(say every record of a call was dropped by the pipeline) commits its candidate at the end of the
call. So a record whose event sits in a partial batch never commits its cursor.

A batch the buffer refuses is lost from memory: a full buffer
(:class:`~carto_edge.pipeline.buffer.BufferFullError`, reason ``buffer_full``) or any other
failure of the append (a full disk, an I/O error, a locked database: ``sqlite3.Error`` or
``OSError``, reason ``buffer_error``). Its events are counted as dropped and the cursor stays
where it was. For a pulled source (:data:`PULL_SOURCE_TYPES`; decided by the source type, not by
whether a record with a cursor was seen yet, because Splunk, SQL and SFTP put the cursor on the
last record of a window, page or listing) the ingestor then also discards the source's pending
events, rolls the candidate back to the committed cursor and refuses every further record of
that source until one ingest call has reported the refusal: a caller that sees a refusal
(:func:`buffer_refused`) in an :class:`~carto_edge.pipeline.ingestor.IngestOutcome` must stop its
read and restart from the committed cursor (the poll scheduler does), so no later cursor can be
committed past the lost events (at-least-once; core dedupes by ``event_id`` and ``batch_id``).
Pushed sources (OTLP and webhooks) lose only the refused batch, and the gateway answers 503 so
the sender keeps it and retries.

Records whose source the sources file does not know are dropped by the pipeline with reason
``unknown_source`` and never reach an accumulator; their metrics carry the label
:data:`UNKNOWN_SOURCE_LABEL`, so a pushed source id cannot mint label values. Metrics and log
lines carry source ids, batch ids, counts and reasons only (spec 2.3 invariant 7).
