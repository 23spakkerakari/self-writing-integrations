# Compose pilot install (M1)

This guide installs the carto pilot stack with Docker Compose on one virtual machine (spec 5.5
"Pilot: Docker Compose on one VM") and connects it to your systems (spec 4.2). It is written for
the platform engineer who runs the install and for the security reviewer who signs it off. Every
command runs from the root of the repository checkout unless a step says otherwise.

## What M1 delivers

M1 is the ingest half of the product: connectors read your systems read-only, `edge-gateway`
parses, classifies, redacts and tokenizes every record, keeps raw identifier values only in the
encrypted reveal vault on the edge, and forwards canonical events over mutual TLS to
`ingest-api`, which writes them to ClickHouse. Nothing in M1 shows you those events yet.

| Capability | Milestone |
| --- | --- |
| Connectors, edge pipeline, disk buffer, forwarding, `ingest-api`, offline analyzer | M1 (this guide; the analyzer has [its own guide](offline-analyzer.md)) |
| Map discovery, link review queue API and UI, field policy UI | M2 |
| Trace search and timeline, map graph UI, reveal flow (the core side of `/internal/tokenize` and `/internal/reveal`) | M3 |
| Watch: expectations, detectors, alerts, channels, status board | M4 |
| Manual hops and cost | M5 |
| SSO and RBAC, Helm, image signatures, TLS to the databases, cloud KMS, backups and restore drill | M6 |

The reverse proxy, `api`, `web` and the workers join the Compose stack from M2 on. The
[known gaps](#known-gaps-in-this-build) at the end of this guide list what the M1 build does not
do yet although this guide or the spec expects it. Read them before you start.

## Prerequisites

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Host | One VM with 8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM and 500 GB SSD (spec 5.5) |
| Container runtime | Docker Engine with the Compose v2 plugin (`docker compose`); BuildKit for `make images` (the Dockerfile uses `RUN --mount=type=cache`; BuildKit is the default builder since Docker Engine 23) |
| Tools | GNU make and `openssl` (the `make` targets use both), `git` |
| Disk encryption | Encryption at rest of the volumes that hold Docker's data is your responsibility and an install requirement (spec 14.4), in addition to carto's own encryption of the vault and keys |
| Clock | NTP-synchronised; certificates, webhook timestamps (300 s window) and internal assertions (at most 5 minutes) depend on it |
| Outbound internet | Not needed to run the stack. Building the images in M1 pulls base images and locked Python packages; build on a connected machine and move the images if the VM is offline (step 2) |
| Vendor access | None. Nothing phones home and no telemetry leaves the VM (spec 2.3 invariant 4; `CARTO_TELEMETRY__ENABLED` defaults to `false`). We never need inbound access |
| Source accounts | Read-only accounts per source, created with the scripts and guides listed under step 7 |

## Step 1: Obtain the release

M1 has no published release artifact. You receive the repository at the M1 tag (or a source
archive of it) and build the images yourself. Signed images in a registry, verified with
`carto-ctl verify-signatures`, arrive in M6 (spec 5.5, 14.8); that command prints a
not-implemented notice in this build.

## Step 2: Build the images

```sh
make images
```

This builds four images from `deploy/docker/base.Dockerfile` (spec 6, 14.6):

| Image | Contents | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `carto-edge:dev` | `carto-edge` | `edge-gateway` |
| `carto-core:dev` | `carto-core` | `migrate`, `ingest-api` |
| `carto-ctl:dev` | `carto-ctl` | `pki-init`, `key-init` |
| `carto-simulator:dev` | `carto-sim` | `simulator` (dev profile only) |

Each runs as uid 10001 with the apt tooling removed; the entrypoint is a `/bin/sh` shim that runs
the member's console script with the container arguments. Compose pulls three third-party images on
first start: `postgres:16.6-bookworm`, `clickhouse/clickhouse-server:24.8` and
`otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.111.0`.

On an offline VM, build elsewhere and transfer the images with the standard Docker commands:

```sh
docker save carto-edge:dev carto-core:dev carto-ctl:dev postgres:16.6-bookworm \
  clickhouse/clickhouse-server:24.8 otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.111.0 \
  -o carto-images.tar
docker load -i carto-images.tar          # on the VM
```

## Step 3: Create the database password files

`compose.yaml` passes the PostgreSQL and ClickHouse passwords as Docker secrets from two files,
never through the environment. `make dev` creates them when they are missing or empty; for a
pilot, create them yourself with the same commands:

```sh
test -s deploy/compose/secrets/pg_password || openssl rand -hex 24 > deploy/compose/secrets/pg_password
test -s deploy/compose/secrets/ch_password || openssl rand -hex 24 > deploy/compose/secrets/ch_password
```

Both files are git-ignored (`deploy/compose/secrets/.gitignore`). Compose mounts them read-only
at `/run/secrets/pg_password` and `/run/secrets/ch_password` in the services that list them, and
the core settings read them through `CARTO_POSTGRES__PASSWORD_FILE` and
`CARTO_CLICKHOUSE__PASSWORD_FILE`. Anyone who can read these files or run `docker` on the VM can
reach the databases: restrict who can log in to the host. The PostgreSQL image applies the
password only when it initialises an empty `pg-data` volume; changing the file later does not
change the database password.

## Step 4: Create the internal PKI (`carto-ctl pki init`)

Every internal connection is mutual TLS with an install-generated private CA (spec 14.4). On
every start the one-shot `volumes-init` job gives the named volumes to uid 10001, then `pki-init`
runs:

```
carto-ctl pki init --out /etc/carto/pki --ca-key-dir /etc/carto/pki-ca \
  --services ingest-api,edge-gateway,otel-collector --if-missing
```

It writes:

| File | Volume | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ca.crt` | `pki` | The private CA certificate (valid 3,650 days) |
| `ca.key` | `pki-ca` | The CA private key, on a volume that no running service mounts |
| `<service>.crt`, `<service>.key` | `pki` | One pair per service, valid 90 days, usable for both server and client authentication, with SANs for the service name, `localhost` and any `--dns` or `--ip` given |

Keys are written with owner-only permissions and never overwritten, and the output lists
certificate fingerprints only. With `--if-missing` a complete earlier run is a success that
writes nothing, so restarting the stack leaves the PKI alone; a partial set (a key without its
certificate) is refused. Options:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--out DIR` | `pki` | Directory to write into |
| `--ca-key-dir DIR` | `--out` | Directory for `ca.key` |
| `--if-missing` | off | Succeed without writing when every file is already present |
| `--services NAME[,NAME...]` | `edge-gateway,ingest-api,otel-collector,api` | Services to issue a pair for |
| `--dns NAME` | none | Extra DNS SAN on every service certificate (repeatable) |
| `--ip ADDR` | none | Extra IP SAN on every service certificate (repeatable) |
| `--days N` | `90` | Service certificate lifetime, 1 to 3,650 |

If a client will reach `edge-gateway` or `ingest-api` by a name other than the service name, or
you want a certificate for a scraper or a collector of your own, run the command yourself before
the first start so the names are in the certificates:

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/compose/compose.yaml run --rm pki-init \
  pki init --out /etc/carto/pki --ca-key-dir /etc/carto/pki-ca \
  --services ingest-api,edge-gateway,otel-collector --dns edge-gateway.example.internal
```

**Rotation.** Service certificates expire after 90 days and this build has no command that
reissues them from the existing CA; automated rotation (spec 14.4) arrives with M6. Before day
90, remove the containers with `docker compose ... down` (never with `-v`, which deletes every
volume), remove the PKI volumes with `docker volume rm carto_pki carto_pki-ca`, and start again
so `pki-init` creates a new CA and new pairs. Copy the new `ca.crt` and collector pair to any collector outside
the stack.

## Step 5: Create the tokenization key (`carto-ctl key init`)

Tokens are HMACs under the tenant key (spec 8.4). The key is generated once, exists at rest only
wrapped by a KMS, is unwrapped into `edge-gateway` memory at startup, and never leaves the
`edge-state` volume: it is never in an environment variable, a config file, an image or a log.
On first start the one-shot `key-init` service runs:

```
carto-ctl key init --state-dir /var/lib/carto --tenant-id default --kms local
```

(plus `--if-missing`, so a restart leaves existing keys alone and a partial set is refused).
It writes, under `/var/lib/carto/keys/`:

| File | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `local-kms.key` | The local KMS master key, 32 bytes, owner-only (`--kms local` only) |
| `tenant-key.json` | Version 1 of the tenant key, wrapped by the KMS and bound to the tenant id and purpose |
| `rotation.json` | Active version 1, no previous versions, 30-day overlap |

`edge-gateway` adds `vault-data-key.json` (the wrapped reveal vault data key) on first start and
`secrets-data-key.json` on the first `local://` secret lookup. The command prints key ids and
fingerprints only. Options:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--state-dir DIR` | `/var/lib/carto-edge` | Edge state directory; keys go under `DIR/keys`. Compose passes `/var/lib/carto` |
| `--tenant-id ID` | `default` | Tenant key domain; keep `default` (v1 is single-tenant) |
| `--kms local\|vault` | `local` | Local master key file or HashiCorp Vault Transit (ADR 0012) |
| `--vault-url URL` | none | Vault address (https) |
| `--vault-transit-key NAME` | `carto` | Transit key name |
| `--vault-mount PATH` | `transit` | Transit mount |
| `--vault-token-file FILE` | none | File holding the Vault token; never an option value or an environment variable |

**Local KMS (pilots).** The master key file sits in the same volume as the keys it wraps, so the
protection is the volume itself: disk encryption, host access control and how you handle
backups. Use it for a pilot only.

**Vault Transit (production).** Create a derived Transit key so Vault enforces the context that
carto binds into every wrap, give the edge a token limited to that key, and initialise with
`--kms vault`:

```sh
vault secrets enable transit
vault write transit/keys/carto derived=true
```

```hcl
# Vault policy for the edge token
path "transit/encrypt/carto" { capabilities = ["update"] }
path "transit/decrypt/carto" { capabilities = ["update"] }
path "kv/data/carto/*"       { capabilities = ["read"] }   # only if secret_ref uses vault://kv/carto/...
```

The command below needs the override file of step 8 with `key-init` on the `sources` network and
given the `vault_token` secret:

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/compose/compose.yaml -f deploy/compose/compose.pilot.yaml run --rm \
  key-init key init --state-dir /var/lib/carto --tenant-id default --kms vault \
  --vault-url https://vault.example.internal:8200 --vault-token-file /run/secrets/vault_token
```

Then set the same KMS on `edge-gateway` in the override file: `CARTO_KMS__PROVIDER` to `vault`,
`CARTO_KMS__VAULT_URL`, `CARTO_KMS__VAULT_TRANSIT_KEY` and `CARTO_KMS__VAULT_MOUNT` when they
differ from `carto` and `transit`, and `CARTO_KMS__VAULT_TOKEN_FILE` pointing at a token file
mounted as a Docker secret. The gateway reads the token file at startup to unwrap the keys.
Vault's certificate must verify against the system trust store of the image; this build has no
setting for a private Vault CA bundle. AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault and GCP KMS arrive in M6
(ADR 0012).

**Rotation and loss.** Key rotation and KMS rewrapping follow
[the key rotation runbook](../runbooks/key-rotation.md) (`carto-edge key status`, `key rotate`,
`key rewrap`, run inside the `edge-gateway` container). Losing every copy of a key version makes
events tokenized under it unjoinable with new events and their vault entries unreadable
(spec 14.11): back the keys up as described under [Operations](#operations).

## Step 6: Database migrations

The one-shot `migrate` service runs `carto-core migrate` once PostgreSQL and ClickHouse are
healthy. It creates the ClickHouse tables `events` and `event_identifiers` with the retention TTL
(`CARTO_RETENTION__EVENTS_DAYS`, default 30, range 7 to 400; spec 14.10) and brings PostgreSQL to
the head revision (the batch ledger and source health tables). It is idempotent: a second run
prints `clickhouse: up to date` and `postgres: at head`. To run it by hand:

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/compose/compose.yaml run --rm migrate
```

`carto-core migrate --clickhouse-only` and `--postgres-only` limit it to one store. The M1 stack
uses one database user, `carto`, for every core service and connects without TLS on the internal
`core` network (`CARTO_POSTGRES__SSLMODE: disable`, ClickHouse over `http://clickhouse:8123`).
Per-service least-privilege users and TLS to both databases (spec 14.4) arrive in M6.

## Step 7: Configure your sources

The gateway reads one sources file (`CARTO_SOURCES_FILE`, mounted at `/etc/carto/sources.yaml`).
Start from the dev file, which is wired to the simulator, and replace its systems and sources:

```sh
cp deploy/compose/sources.dev.yaml deploy/compose/sources.yaml
```

`sources.yaml` holds no secrets (credentials are references, below) but it names internal hosts;
keep it out of public repositories. Step 8 mounts it in place of `sources.dev.yaml`.

### File structure

The file is YAML read with `safe_load`, at most 1 MiB, with unknown keys rejected
(`carto_edge.config.SourcesFile`; spec Appendix A). Validation errors name the location, never
the value.

| Key | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `systems[]` | `id` (`^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}$`), `name`, `owner_group`, `criticality` (`low`, `medium` default, `high`) |
| `sources[]` | `id` (same pattern), `system`, `type` (`upload`, `otlp`, `splunk`, `sql`, `sftp`, `webhook`), `enabled` (default `true`), `config` (validated by the connector), `secret_ref`, `parse`, `backfill_days` (0 to 400, accepted by the schema) |
| `field_policies[]` | Admin pins, below |
| `network.allowed_source_cidrs` | Private ranges connectors may reach, below |

A `config` key whose name contains `password`, `passwd`, `token`, `secret` or `api_key` is
refused: credentials go in `secret_ref`. Parse hints (spec 8.2) apply to every connector:

| `parse` key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `format` | `auto` | `auto`, `ndjson`, `json`, `xml`, `logfmt`, `csv`, `access_log`, `text` |
| `timestamp_field` | tries `ts`, `timestamp`, `@timestamp`, `time`, `_time`, `datetime`, `date`, `eventTime`, `event_time`, `created_at`, `updated_at` | Field holding the source timestamp |
| `timestamp_format` | auto-detect | `iso8601`, `epoch_s`, `epoch_ms` or a strftime pattern |
| `timezone` | `UTC` | IANA zone applied only to timestamps without an offset |
| `message_field` | tries `msg`, `message`, `log`, `body`, `text` | Free-text field mined for a template |
| `severity_field` | none | Level field |
| `actor_field` | none | User or service field; becomes the tokenized `actor` |
| `csv_columns`, `csv_has_header`, `csv_delimiter` | none, `true`, `,` | CSV layout |
| `access_log_pattern` | none | RE2 pattern with named groups |
| `max_record_bytes` | 1 MiB | Larger records are dropped (256 B to 16 MiB) |

### Credentials: `secret_ref`

Connectors receive credentials only as references, resolved at use, cached in memory for at
most 15 minutes, never written to disk in clear and never logged (spec 14.3, ADR 0013):

| Scheme | In this build |
| --- | --- |
| `vault://<mount>/<path>[#<field>]` | HashiCorp Vault KV v2, field `value` by default. Needs `CARTO_KMS__VAULT_URL` and `CARTO_KMS__VAULT_TOKEN_FILE` on `edge-gateway`, also when the KMS provider is `local`. **The pilot path.** |
| `local://<name>` | `secrets.sqlite` in the edge state volume: AES-256-GCM under a KMS-wrapped data key (ADR 0013). For Compose pilots without Vault. Write values with `carto-edge secret set` (below). |
| `aws-sm://`, `azure-kv://`, `gcp-sm://` | Refused with a message naming M6 |

A login (SQL, SFTP password) is one secret value: a JSON object `{"username": ..., "password":
...}` or `user:password` text. Write it from a file so it stays out of shell history:

```sh
vault kv put kv/carto/wms-readonly value=@wms-readonly.json
```

Without Vault, store it in the edge's local store instead (`$COMPOSE` as defined in step 8). The
value comes from a file or standard input, never from an argument, and only the name is printed
and audited:

```sh
$COMPOSE exec -T edge-gateway carto-edge secret set wms-readonly < wms-readonly.json
$COMPOSE exec edge-gateway carto-edge secret list
```

and reference it as `secret_ref: local://wms-readonly`. `carto-edge secret delete <name>` removes
one.

A rotated credential takes effect within 15 minutes or at the next gateway restart.

### Network allow-list: `network.allowed_source_cidrs`

Every connector host is resolved and checked before each connection (spec 14.7, ADR 0018):

- Always refused: loopback, unspecified, multicast and reserved addresses, link-local including
  the cloud metadata address `169.254.169.254` and `fe80::/10`, `fd00:ec2::254`,
  `100.100.100.200` and `0.0.0.0/8`.
- Refused unless inside a listed CIDR: `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`,
  `100.64.0.0/10`, `fc00::/7` and the other ranges Python classes as private.
- A name with any refused address is refused entirely. HTTP (Splunk), PostgreSQL and SFTP
  connect to the validated address while TLS or SSH still verifies the name. MySQL and SQL
  Server validate at each connect but connect by name, so a rebinding window remains: give
  those hosts fixed entries with `extra_hosts` in the override file (step 8).

List only your source subnets. Never list the Docker networks of this stack (usually inside
`172.16.0.0/12`): that would let a connector be pointed at `ingest-api` or the databases.

```yaml
network:
  allowed_source_cidrs: ["10.20.0.0/16"]
```

### Field policy pins

Pins override the classifier for one field (spec 8.3) until the field policy UI arrives (M2).
`field` is a `field_ref` (`system/template/path`) or a pattern with `*` for the system or the
template (`sys_orders/*/order_id`).

```yaml
field_policies:
  - field: sys_warehouse/*/customer_name
    field_class: person_name
    policy: tokenize
    forms: ["phonetic"]
    reason: "composite link: clerks key the cardholder name into the PO"
```

`policy` is `keep`, `tokenize` or `drop`; `forms` takes the families `raw`, `norm`, `alnum`,
`digits`, `date`, `amount`, `phonetic` or exact form names such as `digits.0`. `secret_like`
fields are always dropped and the PII classes (`person_name`, `contact`, `government_id`,
`financial`, `health`) can never be kept in clear; the file is refused otherwise. A `keep` pin on
an identifier sends its values to core in clear: agree it with your security reviewer. Every
change to the pins changes `policy_version`, which each event carries.

### One example per connector type

Each example below is a `sources[]` entry. Config keys are those of the connector modules in
`edge/carto_edge/connectors/`; files they name (CA bundles, mounted directories) must exist
inside the `edge-gateway` container, so mount them in the override file.

#### SQL polling: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server (spec 8.1.4)

Create a dedicated login with the script for your engine, run it on a **read replica** (SQL
Server: through the availability group listener; carto connects with
`ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly`), and prefer a view that exposes only the columns carto needs:
[PostgreSQL](read-only-roles/postgresql.sql), [MySQL](read-only-roles/mysql.sql),
[SQL Server](read-only-roles/sqlserver.sql).

```yaml
  - id: src_wms_db
    system: sys_warehouse
    type: sql
    config:
      dialect: postgresql                 # postgresql, mysql or mssql
      host: wms-replica.example.internal
      port: 5432
      database: wms
      sslmode: verify-full
      ca_file: /etc/carto/ca/wms-replica-ca.pem
      poll_seconds: 60
      queries:
        - name: purchase_orders
          sql: >
            SELECT id, po_num, order_ref, status, warehouse_code, created_by, updated_at
            FROM carto_purchase_orders
            WHERE updated_at > :watermark
            ORDER BY updated_at
            LIMIT :batch
          watermark_column: updated_at
          primary_key: id
    secret_ref: vault://kv/carto/wms-readonly
    parse:
      timestamp_field: updated_at
      timezone: America/New_York          # the column holds naive local time
      actor_field: created_by
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dialect` | required | `postgresql`, `mysql`, `mssql` |
| `host`, `port`, `database` | port 5432, 3306 or 1433 by dialect | Bare host name or address |
| `sslmode` | `verify-full` | PostgreSQL libpq mode |
| `ssl` | `true` | MySQL: TLS with certificate verification |
| `encrypt`, `trust_server_certificate`, `driver` | `true`, `false`, `ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server` | SQL Server |
| `ca_file` | none | CA bundle for the server certificate |
| `poll_seconds` | 60 | 5 to 86,400 |
| `query_timeout_seconds`, `connect_timeout_seconds` | 30, 10 | Timeouts |
| `batch`, `max_pages_per_read` | 1,000, 100 | Rows per page bound to `:batch`; pages per poll |
| `failure_threshold`, `breaker_reset_seconds` | 5, 60 | Circuit breaker |
| `queries[]` | 1 to 64 | `name`, `sql`, `watermark_column`, `primary_key` (default: the first column), `timestamp_column`, `actor_column` |

Read-only enforcement has three layers: the grants, read-only sessions (PostgreSQL
`default_transaction_read_only` and `BEGIN READ ONLY`, MySQL `START TRANSACTION READ ONLY`, SQL
Server `ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly`) and a parser check that accepts a single `SELECT` or
`WITH ... SELECT` with no bind parameters other than `:watermark` and `:batch`. The connector's
test refuses a login that can INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE or alter anything. The gateway runs every
pull connector's test before its first poll and never polls a source whose test fails or finds a
write-capable credential (`scheduler.source_not_enabled` in its log, with the failed check
names); it retries with backoff, so a corrected grant starts the source without a restart. Run
the test yourself (`$COMPOSE` as defined in step 8) before you enable a source, and after any
grant change:

```sh
$COMPOSE exec edge-gateway carto-edge source test --source src_wms_db
```

It prints each check and exits 1 when a source cannot be enabled. The Test button of Setup ›
Sources (spec 4.2) arrives with the UI.

A query's `timestamp_column` and `actor_column` (spec Appendix A) name the row's clock and actor;
they take precedence over the source's `parse.timestamp_field` and `parse.actor_field`. The actor
column is tokenized into the event's `actor`, never kept as an attribute (spec 7.1). SQL Server support
is implemented and verified against a live server at the first deployment that needs it
(ADR 0019); see the known gaps for the image.

#### Splunk pull (spec 8.1.3)

Create the search-only role and token with the [Splunk role guide](splunk-role.md) and store the
token in Vault as the whole secret value.

```yaml
  - id: src_orders_splunk
    system: sys_orders
    type: splunk
    config:
      base_url: https://splunk.example.internal:8089
      search: "search index=orders sourcetype=order_svc"
      window_minutes: 5
      overlap_minutes: 2
      max_concurrency: 2
      ca_file: /etc/carto/ca/splunk-ca.pem
    secret_ref: vault://kv/carto/splunk-orders-token
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base_url` | required | Origin only (`https://host:port`, no path, no credentials) |
| `search` | required | The search string run through `/services/search/jobs/export` |
| `window_minutes`, `overlap_minutes` | 5, 2 | Sliding windows and their overlap; results are deduplicated on `_cd`, `_indextime` and a hash |
| `max_concurrency`, `backfill_chunk_minutes` | 2, 60 | Backfill protection for the search head |
| `verify_tls`, `ca_file` | `true`, none | Certificate verification and a custom CA |
| `allow_plaintext` | `false` | Admin flag to allow `http://`; leave it off |
| `timeout_seconds`, `requests_per_second` | 120, 2 | Request timeout and rate limit |
| `dedupe_size`, `max_windows_per_read` | 100,000, 288 | Deduplication memory; windows per poll |
| `failure_threshold`, `breaker_reset_seconds` | 5, 60 | Circuit breaker |

Splunk's extracted fields are parsed; `_raw`, `linecount` and `splunk_server` are dropped and
`_time` is among the default timestamp fields. The test reads the token's roles and capabilities
and reports the token as write-capable when any capability starts with `edit_`, `delete_`,
`admin_`, `change_`, `restart_` or `output_file`.

#### SFTP or file-drop watch (spec 8.1.5)

The connector lists directories and reads `stat` results only: it never opens, writes, renames or
deletes a file, and emits `file_arrived` and `file_removed` events from names, sizes and times.
SFTP exposes no grant query, so the read-only status cannot be verified from carto: make the
account read-only on the server (no write permission on the listed directories, ideally a
chroot). The host key is pinned; obtain its SHA-256 fingerprint and confirm it with the server's
administrator out of band:

```sh
ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 sftp.example.internal | ssh-keygen -lf -
```

```yaml
  - id: src_ship_sftp
    system: sys_shipping
    type: sftp
    config:
      host: sftp.example.internal
      port: 22
      username: carto_ro
      host_key_sha256: "SHA256:REPLACE_WITH_THE_43_CHARACTER_FINGERPRINT"
      directories: ["/outbound/shipping"]
      filename_patterns: ["SHIP_*.csv"]
      poll_seconds: 60
    secret_ref: vault://kv/carto/sftp-readonly
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host`, `port`, `username` | port 22 | Required for a remote source |
| `host_key_sha256` | required for a remote source | `SHA256:` plus 43 base64 characters; any other key is refused |
| `directories` | required | Remote paths, or all `local:///absolute/path` for a directory mounted into the container (SMB or NFS mounts included) |
| `filename_patterns` | `["*"]` | Shell patterns |
| `poll_seconds` | 60 | 5 to 86,400 |
| `connect_timeout_seconds`, `max_entries_per_directory` | 15, 100,000 | Limits |

The secret is a private key (PEM text, or JSON `{"private_key": ..., "passphrase": ...}`) or a
password (`{"username": ..., "password": ...}` or `user:password`). The dev file watches a local
directory instead: `directories: ["local:///data/sim/shipping/outbound"]`, no host, no secret.

#### Webhook receiver (spec 8.1.6)

Systems that can POST JSON send it to `POST /webhooks/<source_id>` on `edge-gateway`.

```yaml
  - id: src_carrier_webhook
    system: sys_shipping
    type: webhook
    config:
      signature_header: X-Carto-Signature
      timestamp_header: X-Carto-Timestamp
      timestamp_window_seconds: 300
      event_type_field: event
    secret_ref: vault://kv/carto/carrier-webhook-hmac
```

The shared secret must be at least 16 characters. The sender puts the hex HMAC-SHA256 of the raw
body under the secret in `X-Carto-Signature`, as `v1=<hex>`, `sha256=<hex>` or bare hex. When it
also sends `X-Carto-Timestamp` (epoch seconds), the signed text is `<timestamp>.<body>` and the
timestamp must be within `timestamp_window_seconds`; send it, because without it a captured
request can be replayed. Unsigned requests are rejected. The body is a JSON object or an array of
at most `max_records` (1,000) objects, at most `max_body_bytes` (1 MB) and `max_json_depth` (32)
deep; `event_type_field` names the field whose value becomes the template. The gateway answers
401 for a bad or missing signature, 404 for an unknown or non-webhook source, 413 above the size
limit, 400 for a bad body, 503 when the secret cannot be resolved, and 429 or 503 under
backpressure. In M1 the gateway listener requires a client certificate from the
install CA on every route and Compose publishes no port, so only senders inside the stack can
reach it (see the known gaps).

#### OTLP through the OpenTelemetry Collector (spec 8.1.2)

Log files, syslog, Splunk HEC and OTLP reach the edge through the upstream Collector, which keeps
a persistent queue and forwards OTLP/HTTP (protobuf, zstd) to `edge-gateway` over mutual TLS.
Each source is an `otlp` entry with an empty `config`; the parse hints stay here, because the
edge parses and the collector does not:

```yaml
  - id: src_orders_log
    system: sys_orders
    type: otlp
    config: {}
    parse:
      format: logfmt
      timestamp_field: ts
      timestamp_format: iso8601
      timezone: UTC
      message_field: msg
      severity_field: level
```

Copy the template [`otel/collector.yaml`](../../otel/collector.yaml) to
`deploy/compose/collector.yaml` and edit it:

- One receiver per source, each setting the `carto.source_id` resource attribute to the source
  id above; applications that send OTLP must set that resource attribute themselves. Records
  without it are dropped by the `filter/require_source` processor, and the gateway rejects
  records whose id is not an enabled `otlp` source.
- Keep the receivers you use in `service.pipelines.logs.receivers` and delete the others.
- The `otlphttp/edge` exporter uses `ca_file`, `cert_file` and `key_file` from the `pki` volume
  (`/etc/carto/pki/ca.crt`, `otel-collector.crt`, `otel-collector.key`) and the endpoint
  `https://edge-gateway:8443` (the collector appends `/v1/logs`).

The gateway accepts `application/x-protobuf` with `gzip` or `zstd`, at most 4 MiB after
decompression (`CARTO_GATEWAY__OTLP_MAX_BODY_BYTES`) and 10,000 log records per request. In the
M1 stack no collector port is published, so tail files by mounting their directories read-only
into the `otel-collector` container (step 8); the syslog (5140), Splunk HEC (8088) and OTLP (4317,
4318) receivers of the template are reachable only from inside the `edge` network.

#### Upload: files mounted into the gateway

An `upload` source reads local files inside the `edge-gateway` container, polled every
`CARTO_GATEWAY__POLL_SECONDS` (60) and resumed from a `{file, line}` cursor. Its keys are those of
the offline analyzer ([offline-analyzer.md](offline-analyzer.md)) with absolute `paths`; the dev
file uses one for the simulator's warehouse row stream.

## Step 8: The pilot override file

As shipped, `compose.yaml` mounts `sources.dev.yaml`, mounts `otel/collector.dev.yaml`, and puts
every service on two `internal: true` networks, which have no route outside Docker. A pilot
needs to change all three. The repository does not ship a pilot override in M1; create
`deploy/compose/compose.pilot.yaml` (relative paths in it resolve against `deploy/compose/`):

```yaml
# deploy/compose/compose.pilot.yaml: your pilot's changes to compose.yaml (you create this file).
networks:
  sources: {}                     # not internal: edge-gateway's route to your source hosts

services:
  edge-gateway:
    networks: [edge, sources]
    volumes:
      - ./sources.yaml:/etc/carto/sources.yaml:ro              # replaces sources.dev.yaml
      - /etc/carto-pilot/ca:/etc/carto/ca:ro                    # CA bundles your sources need
    # extra_hosts:                                             # fixed entries for MySQL and SQL Server
    #   - "wms-replica.example.internal:10.20.4.17"
    environment:                                               # for vault:// secret_ref values
      CARTO_KMS__VAULT_URL: https://vault.example.internal:8200
      CARTO_KMS__VAULT_TOKEN_FILE: /run/secrets/vault_token
    secrets: [vault_token]

  otel-collector:
    volumes:
      - ./collector.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml:ro    # replaces collector.dev.yaml
      - /var/log/order-svc:/var/log/order-svc:ro                # one line per directory you tail

secrets:
  vault_token:
    file: /etc/carto-pilot/vault_token                         # outside the checkout
```

Compose mounts secret files with their host permissions; the services run as uid 10001, so make
the token file readable by that uid only (`chown 10001 /etc/carto-pilot/vault_token` and `chmod
0400`). The `sources` network gives the gateway unrestricted egress at the Docker level; restrict
it to your source hosts and Vault with host firewall rules, as spec 14.5 asks of the edge
("egress to configured source hosts only"; NetworkPolicies do this on Kubernetes in M6). With the
Vault KMS, also put `key-init` on the `sources` network and give it the `vault_token` secret.

Use both files for every command from here on:

```sh
COMPOSE="docker compose -f deploy/compose/compose.yaml -f deploy/compose/compose.pilot.yaml"
```

## Step 9: Start

```sh
$COMPOSE up -d
$COMPOSE ps
```

Start-up order is fixed by `depends_on`: `volumes-init` runs first; `migrate` runs once
`postgres` and `clickhouse` are healthy; `pki-init` and `key-init` run after `volumes-init`; `ingest-api` starts after `migrate` and
`pki-init` have completed; `edge-gateway` starts when `ingest-api` is healthy and `key-init` has
completed; `otel-collector` follows `edge-gateway`. The four one-shot jobs show as exited with
code 0 on every start. The simulator does not start without the `dev` profile. `ingest-api`'s
health check is `carto-core healthcheck --url https://localhost:8443/healthz`, which presents
the service's own certificate.

## Step 10: Verify

**Health and metrics.** Both services listen with mutual TLS on port 8443 inside the stack, so
check them from inside each container with its own certificate (the images have no curl; Python
is there):

```sh
for svc in ingest-api edge-gateway; do
$COMPOSE exec -T -e SVC=$svc $svc python - <<'EOF'
import os, ssl, urllib.request
svc, pki = os.environ["SVC"], "/etc/carto/pki/"
ctx = ssl.create_default_context(cafile=pki + "ca.crt")
ctx.load_cert_chain(pki + svc + ".crt", pki + svc + ".key")
for path in ("/healthz", "/readyz"):
    print(svc, path, urllib.request.urlopen("https://localhost:8443" + path, context=ctx).status)
text = urllib.request.urlopen("https://localhost:8443/metrics", context=ctx).read().decode()
print("\n".join(line for line in text.splitlines() if line.startswith("carto_")))
EOF
done
```

| Service | Metrics (Prometheus text, `GET /metrics`, internal network only; spec 16) |
| --- | --- |
| `edge-gateway` | Counters `carto_edge_records_total`, `carto_edge_events_total`, `carto_edge_dropped_total` (by source and reason), `carto_edge_vault_entries_total`, `carto_edge_batches_sealed_total`, `carto_edge_batches_sent_total`, `carto_edge_batches_parked_total`, `carto_edge_send_errors_total`, `carto_edge_heartbeats_total`, `carto_edge_requests_total`, `carto_edge_connector_errors_total`; gauges `carto_edge_buffer_bytes`, `carto_edge_buffer_depth`, `carto_edge_buffer_oldest_age_seconds`, `carto_edge_backpressure` (0 ok, 1 above 80%, 2 full), `carto_edge_connector_lag_seconds`, `carto_edge_key_versions` |
| `ingest-api` | `carto_ingest_batches_total`, `carto_ingest_events_total`, `carto_ingest_duplicates_total`, `carto_ingest_errors_total`, `carto_heartbeats_total` |

The stack has no Prometheus server in M1. A scraper needs a client certificate from the install
CA, so name it in `--services` when you run `pki init` (step 4).

**Events in ClickHouse.**

```sh
$COMPOSE exec clickhouse sh -c 'clickhouse-client --user carto --password "$(cat /run/secrets/ch_password)" \
  --database carto --query "SELECT source_id, count() FROM events GROUP BY source_id"'
```

**Logs.** Every carto service writes one JSON object per line through the redaction processor of
`carto_common.logging` (spec 14.12, ADR 0010): secret-named keys are `[REDACTED]`, body keys
`[DROPPED]`, and PEM blocks, JWTs, carto tokens, e-mail addresses and high-entropy strings are
masked; request and response bodies are never logged.

```sh
$COMPOSE logs --tail 100 edge-gateway ingest-api
```

A raw identifier, a name or a secret in these logs is a security defect: report it to us.

## The dev profile with the simulator

`make dev` is the development stack, not a pilot: it builds the images, creates the two password
files, and runs `docker compose -f deploy/compose/compose.yaml --profile dev up --remove-orphans`
in the foreground. The `simulator` service runs `carto-sim live --scenario shop --days 2 --speed
60 --out /data/sim`, replaying two simulated days of scenario A into the `sim-data` volume in
about 48 minutes (see "Live mode" in [simulator/README.md](../../simulator/README.md)). The
collector tails the five log sources with `otel/collector.dev.yaml`, the gateway watches the
`SHIP_*.csv` drops with the SFTP connector's `local://` mode, and the warehouse rows are read as
NDJSON log records because the dev stack has no source database (the header of
`deploy/compose/sources.dev.yaml` describes this gap). `make dev-down` stops the stack and
**removes every volume**, keys and vault included: never run it against a pilot.

## Operations

### Back up the edge state volume

`carto_edge-state` (mounted at `/var/lib/carto`) is the only place the tokenization key, the
reveal vault and the edge audit trail exist (ADR 0014, 0025):

| Path | Content | Loss means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `keys/` | `local-kms.key` (local KMS only), `tenant-key.json`, `tenant-key.v<n>.json` during a rotation overlap, `rotation.json`, `vault-data-key.json`, `secrets-data-key.json`, `assertion-public.key` (M3) | Old tokens unjoinable with new ones; vault and local secrets unreadable |
| `vault.sqlite` | Reveal vault: token to AES-256-GCM ciphertext of the raw value, expiring with event retention | Reveal impossible for past events |
| `audit.ndjson` | Hash-chained record of every tokenize and reveal call | Loss of the edge's independent audit record |
| `cursors.sqlite` | Connector positions | Sources re-read; core deduplicates |
| `buffer.sqlite` | Batches not yet acknowledged by core | Those events are lost |
| `secrets.sqlite` | `local://` secrets | Re-enter them |
| `field_stats.json`, `templates/` | Field statistics and Drain3 state, so template ids survive restarts | Fields re-quarantined; templates re-learned |

With the local KMS a backup holds the master key next to the keys it wraps: encrypt the backup
and store it apart from the VM. With Vault Transit the backup is useless without Vault. Stop the
gateway so the SQLite files are consistent, copy, restart (the backup directory must be writable
by uid 10001):

```sh
$COMPOSE stop edge-gateway
docker run --rm --network none --entrypoint tar -v carto_edge-state:/var/lib/carto:ro \
  -v /srv/carto-backup:/backup carto-edge:dev -czf /backup/edge-state.tgz -C /var/lib/carto .
$COMPOSE start edge-gateway
```

Back up after `key init` and every key change, and at least daily for the vault and audit file
(spec 14.11 targets an RPO of 24 hours). PostgreSQL and ClickHouse backup tooling and the
`carto-ctl drill restore` drill arrive in M6.

### Buffer, batching and backpressure

The gateway seals batches of at most 5,000 events or 5 MB (zstd), or after 2 seconds, appends them
to `buffer.sqlite`, and only then commits the source cursor (at-least-once; core deduplicates by
batch id, ADR 0015). The forwarder posts the oldest pending batch to `ingest-api`, retries 429,
5xx and network errors with jittered backoff up to 60 seconds, and parks batches that `ingest-api`
refuses for good (400, 403, 413, 415, 422). Parked batches count toward the cap and appear in
`carto_edge_batches_parked_total`; this build has no command to inspect or clear them.

The buffer is capped at 20 GiB (`CARTO_BUFFER__MAX_BYTES`). Above 80%
(`CARTO_BUFFER__BACKPRESSURE_RATIO`) pull sources pause and the push routes answer 429; when full
they answer 503. The collector then retries without a time limit (`max_elapsed_time: 0`) and
holds batches in its persistent queue on the `otel-queue` volume; size `sending_queue.queue_size`
and that volume for the longest core outage you want to ride out. Watch
`carto_edge_buffer_oldest_age_seconds` and `carto_edge_backpressure`.

### Edge settings reference

`edge-gateway` reads `CARTO_` environment variables with `__` between levels
(`carto_edge.config.EdgeSettings`). Settings never hold secrets or key material.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CARTO_STATE_DIR` | `/var/lib/carto-edge` (Compose: `/var/lib/carto`) | State directory |
| `CARTO_SOURCES_FILE` | none | Sources file |
| `CARTO_TENANT_ID` | `default` | Must match `key init --tenant-id` |
| `CARTO_RETENTION__EVENTS_DAYS` | 30 | Vault expiry; set the same value on the core services |
| `CARTO_CORE__URL`, `__CA_FILE`, `__CERT_FILE`, `__KEY_FILE` | none | `ingest-api` address (`https://` only) and mTLS files |
| `CARTO_CORE__BATCH_EVENTS`, `__BATCH_BYTES`, `__BATCH_FLUSH_SECONDS` | 5,000, 5 MiB, 2 | Batch limits |
| `CARTO_CORE__HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`, `__RETRY_MAX_SECONDS`, `__TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 30, 60, 30 | Heartbeats, backoff cap, request timeout |
| `CARTO_KMS__PROVIDER` | `local` | `local` or `vault` |
| `CARTO_KMS__LOCAL_KEY_FILE` | `<state>/keys/local-kms.key` | Local master key |
| `CARTO_KMS__VAULT_URL`, `__VAULT_TRANSIT_KEY`, `__VAULT_MOUNT`, `__VAULT_TOKEN_FILE` | none, `carto`, `transit`, none | Vault Transit and KV |
| `CARTO_CLASSIFY__DISTINCT_THRESHOLD`, `__DISTINCT_RATIO`, `__QUARANTINE_SAMPLES` | 1,000, 0.2, 200 | Classifier thresholds (spec 8.3) |
| `CARTO_BUFFER__MAX_BYTES`, `__BACKPRESSURE_RATIO` | 20 GiB, 0.8 | Disk buffer |
| `CARTO_REVEAL__VALUES_PER_USER_PER_HOUR`, `__MAX_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST` | 100, 20 | Reveal limits (spec 8.4) |
| `CARTO_REVEAL__ASSERTION_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE` | `<state>/keys/assertion-public.key` | Core's public key; until it exists (M3) `/internal/tokenize` and `/internal/reveal` answer 503 |
| `CARTO_PII__ENABLED`, `__SPACY_MODEL`, `__SCORE_THRESHOLD` | `true`, `en_core_web_sm`, 0.5 | PII detection (ADR 0020) |
| `CARTO_GATEWAY__HOST`, `__PORT` | `127.0.0.1` (Compose: `0.0.0.0`), 8443 | Listener |
| `CARTO_GATEWAY__TLS_CERT_FILE`, `__TLS_KEY_FILE`, `__TLS_CLIENT_CA_FILE` | none | Listener mTLS files |
| `CARTO_GATEWAY__OTLP_MAX_BODY_BYTES`, `__WEBHOOK_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | 4 MiB, 1 MiB | Body caps |
| `CARTO_GATEWAY__POLL_SECONDS`, `__POLL_CONCURRENCY` | 60, 4 | Pull scheduling when a connector names no interval |

### Audit file

`audit.ndjson` is append-only and hash-chained (`prev_hash`, `row_hash`; ADR 0014). The gateway
refuses to start when the chain is broken. Check it with
`carto-edge audit verify --file /var/lib/carto/audit.ndjson` inside the `edge-gateway` container.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ingest-api` never becomes healthy, so `edge-gateway` never starts | Migrations failed, or the `pki` volume is incomplete | `$COMPOSE logs migrate ingest-api`; check `pki-init` exited 0 |
| `pki init` exits 1: `refusing to overwrite existing private key(s)` | A partial PKI on the `pki` or `pki-ca` volume | Remove both volumes and start again (step 4) |
| `edge-gateway` exits: `local KMS master key ... not found; run carto-ctl key init` | `key-init` did not run against this volume | Run step 5 |
| Unwrap fails after changing `CARTO_TENANT_ID` | The wrapped keys are bound to the tenant id | Keep `default` in v1 |
| `sources file is invalid: <location>: <message>` | Schema error | Fix the named location |
| `config key '...' looks like a credential; use secret_ref instead` | A credential in `config` | Move it to Vault and reference it |
| A connector error naming the network policy | Host resolves to a refused address or a private range not listed | Add the source subnet to `allowed_source_cidrs`; never loopback or metadata |
| `a remote source needs host, username and host_key_sha256` | SFTP config | Add the three keys |
| SFTP connection refused after a server change | Host key no longer matches the pin | Confirm the new key out of band, update `host_key_sha256` |
| `vault:// secret references need kms.vault_url and kms.vault_token_file` | Vault settings missing | Set both on `edge-gateway` (step 8) |
| `unknown local secret '...'` | The name is not in the local store | `carto-edge secret list`; store it with `carto-edge secret set` |
| `... secret references arrive in M6 (ADR 0013)` | Cloud secret manager scheme | Use `vault://` |
| `scheduler.source_not_enabled` in the gateway log, or `carto-edge source test` exits 1 | The source's test failed or the login can write | Read the failed checks with `carto-edge source test --source <id>`; fix the grants with the role script |
| Collector logs 429 or 503 from the edge | Backpressure: buffer above 80% or full | Check `ingest-api` health, `carto_edge_send_errors_total`, `carto_edge_buffer_oldest_age_seconds` |
| Collector TLS handshake errors | Endpoint name not in the `edge-gateway` certificate | Use `edge-gateway`, or reissue with `--dns` (step 4) |
| `carto_edge_dropped_total` grows with reason `unknown_source`, or OTLP partial success counts rejected records | `carto.source_id` does not match an enabled `otlp` source | Align the collector receivers with `sources.yaml` |
| Webhook 401, 404, 413 or 400 | Signature or timestamp, unknown source, body over 1 MB, malformed body | See the webhook section |
| PostgreSQL authentication fails after editing `pg_password` | The image applies the password only on first initialisation | Restore the original file or reset the password inside PostgreSQL |
| `audit chain broken at line N` and the gateway stops | `audit.ndjson` was edited or truncated | Treat as a security incident; restore from backup |
| `/internal/tokenize` or `/internal/reveal` answer 503 | No assertion public key | Expected until M3 |

## Security notes

- **Read-only toward your systems** (spec 2.3 invariant 1). The connector framework has no write
  method, a Semgrep rule fails CI on mutating calls in connector modules, SQL runs in read-only
  sessions behind a single-SELECT check, Splunk uses only the search export endpoint, SFTP only
  lists and stats, and upload sources open local files for reading.
- **Containers** (spec 14.6). Every service runs with a read-only root filesystem,
  `no-new-privileges`, `cap_drop: ALL` and a `/tmp` tmpfs (64 MB; 256 MB for ClickHouse), with
  JSON log files rotated at 20 MB, five per service. The carto images run as uid 10001 and the
  collector as `10001:10001`. The PostgreSQL and ClickHouse entrypoints start as root to fix the
  ownership of their data directory and then drop to their own user, so those two get back
  `CHOWN`, `DAC_OVERRIDE`, `FOWNER`, `SETGID` and `SETUID` only. `volumes-init` runs as root with
  `CHOWN` only and no network; the other one-shot jobs and the simulator have no network either.
- **Ports.** `compose.yaml` publishes no port on the host. All services sit on the `core` and
  `edge` networks, both `internal: true`; `ingest-api` is the only service on both. Inside the
  stack: `ingest-api` and `edge-gateway` on 8443 (mutual TLS), PostgreSQL 5432, ClickHouse 8123
  (HTTP, the interface carto uses), and the collector's health check (13133) and metrics (8888)
  on its loopback only. Your override
  adds egress for `edge-gateway` (step 8).
- **Mutual TLS.** Both listeners require a client certificate signed by the install CA (TLS 1.2
  minimum). The CA key lives on the `pki-ca` volume, which only `pki-init` mounts, so no running
  service can mint certificates. In M1 the listeners authorise by CA membership, not by
  certificate name, and the `pki` volume (every service key) is mounted read-only into
  `ingest-api`, `edge-gateway` and `otel-collector`: treat those three containers as one trust
  domain. Kubernetes installs use cert-manager with one secret per service (M6).
- **Secrets and keys.** Database passwords come from files; connector credentials from Vault
  references; key material exists only wrapped, in the `edge-state` volume. None of them is in
  an environment variable, an image or a log.
- **What reaches core.** Tokens, shapes, templates with parameters removed, low-cardinality
  attributes and timestamps; raw identifier values only in the edge vault (spec 2.3 invariant 2).
  An identifier whose values repeat a lot (a nightly batch or manifest id) has few distinct
  values; when its values contain a run of four or more digits it is tokenized anyway (ADR
  0029). One without digits (`MAN-ALPHA`) is kept in clear unless pinned: review the kept fields
  and pin such identifiers to `tokenize` (Field policy pins, step 7). The reverse also holds: a
  harmless field with four digits (a year, a port) is tokenized until you pin it to `keep`. The leak test (spec
  18.3, `make leak`) checks bundles, forwarded batches, logs and ClickHouse rows for planted
  marker values, and CI replays the simulator through this stack and scans ClickHouse and the
  service logs the same way.
- **Logs.** The gateway writes its own access line (method, route template, status, duration);
  the raw path and query string are never logged, and the HTTP client libraries are held at
  WARNING because their INFO lines carry full URLs (spec 14.12).
- **Images.** The runtime base is `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` with `/bin/sh` kept for the
  entrypoint shim. Distroless bases pinned by digest, cosign signatures and SLSA provenance
  arrive in M6.

## Known gaps in this build

These are things this guide or the spec expects that the M1 build does not do yet.

1. The edge image does not include unixODBC or the Microsoft ODBC Driver 18, so SQL Server
   sources cannot run from it (installing the driver means accepting Microsoft's licence terms in
   the image build; ADR 0019).
2. With both networks internal and no published port, push sources on other hosts (syslog,
   Splunk HEC, OTLP from applications, webhooks) cannot reach the stack; webhook senders would
   also need a client certificate from the install CA, because the gateway requires one on every
   route. Pull sources work through the override's egress network.
3. No pilot override file ships with the repository, and there is no Prometheus scraper, no
   command to reissue service certificates from the existing CA, and no command to inspect or
   clear parked batches.
4. The listeners authorise any certificate from the install CA (see Security notes), and the
   reveal service keeps its nonce and rate-limit state in memory, so a gateway restart resets
   them; both matter from M3, when core calls the internal endpoints.
5. Identifiers with naturally low cardinality and no run of four digits are kept in clear
   unless pinned (ADR 0026, ADR 0029).
