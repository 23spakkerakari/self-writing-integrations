# Threat model

Maintained per spec Section 15. Reviewed at the end of every milestone; the review log is at the
bottom. Each row names the mitigation and the automated check that proves it.

| # | Threat | Mitigations | Verified by | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Stolen connector credentials used to read customer systems | Secret manager references, least privilege, read-only verification, rotation, egress policies | Secrets never present in DB, API responses or logs (tests) | M1 |
| 2 | Core database exfiltration | Core holds tokens, shapes and low-cardinality attributes only | Leak test (Section 18.3) | M1 |
| 3 | Dictionary attack on tokens through search | Rate limits, audit, self-alert on unusual search volume per user, key never leaves edge | Rate-limit and audit tests | M3 |
| 4 | Malicious log content causing XSS | Text-only rendering, strict CSP | Playwright XSS corpus | M2 |
| 5 | Prompt injection through log content | Data fencing, no tools, schema-validated output, human confirmation | Injection corpus yields only schema-valid suggestions | M2 |
| 6 | SSRF via connector or channel URLs | DNS resolution checks, IP pinning, allowlists | SSRF suite (metadata IPs, rebinding, redirects) | M1 |
| 7 | ReDoS, XXE, zip bombs | RE2, defusedxml, archive limits | Payload fixtures | M1 |
| 8 | Insider bulk-revealing values | Separate grant, step-up auth, rate limits, audit, alert on bulk reveal | Authz and rate tests | M3 |
| 9 | Supply chain compromise | Signed images, SBOM, pinned dependencies, scanners, CODEOWNERS | CI gates | M0 (lockfile with hashes, scanners, SBOM signing, CODEOWNERS, Renovate); images from M1 |
| 10 | Log flood or denial of service | Backpressure, per-source quotas, buffer caps, flood sampling that keeps errors | Load tests | M1 |
| 11 | Audit tampering | Hash chain, INSERT-only grants, external anchoring | `audit verify` test | M6 |
| 12 | Session hijack, CSRF | Cookie flags, CSRF tokens, short sessions, step-up | Security tests, ZAP | M6 |
| 13 | Accidental write to a source system | No write paths, read-only sessions, grant checks, Semgrep rule | Read-only tests | M0 (Semgrep rule with self-test); connectors M1 |
| 14 | PHI leaking into chat or email | `include_identifiers` off by default, UI warning | Notification content tests | M4 |
| 15 | Loss of tokenization key | KMS-managed wrapping, documented backup and recovery | Restore drill | M6 |

## Assets

Raw identifier values and PII (edge only), the tokenization key (edge memory, KMS-wrapped at
rest), the reveal vault, connector credentials (customer secret manager), the customer's
integration architecture (core), the audit log.

## Trust boundaries

Customer systems to edge (read-only, least privilege), edge to core (mTLS, tokenized data only),
core to channels and LLM endpoint (allowlisted egress, metadata only), users to API (OIDC, RBAC,
step-up for reveal).

## Review log

- **M0 (2026-10-06):** no runtime components exist yet. Established: hashed lockfile, CI
  scanners failing on high and critical findings, SBOM generation and keyless signing on `main`,
  CODEOWNERS for the sensitive paths, Renovate with pinned action digests, the Semgrep read-only
  connector rule with a self-test, and a simulator that plants marker values for the M1 leak
  test. The simulator writes synthetic PII only (names, emails and addresses are generated and
  carry markers); no real customer data exists in the repository.
- **M1 (2026-10-10):** the edge pipeline, the six connectors, `edge-gateway`, `ingest-api`, the
  offline analyzer and the Compose pilot stack exist (plan M1, ADRs 0011 to 0026).
  - *Assets added:* tokenization key material under the edge state directory (`keys/`: the
    KMS-wrapped tenant key versions, the reveal vault and local secret store data keys, and with
    the local KMS the master key file itself, owner-only); the reveal vault (`vault.sqlite`,
    AES-256-GCM per value, AAD tenant plus token); the disk buffer (`buffer.sqlite`, batches
    already tokenized, up to 20 GiB); connector credentials, referenced by `secret_ref` and
    resolved at use (`vault://` against Vault KV v2; `local://` against the KMS-wrapped
    `secrets.sqlite`); the edge audit file (`audit.ndjson`, hash-chained; ADR 0014); the internal
    service keys in the Compose `pki` volume and the CA key in the separate `pki-ca` volume that
    only the `pki-init` job mounts; the analyzer's state directory, as
    sensitive as an installed edge (ADR 0025).
  - *Trust boundary changes:* collector to `edge-gateway` over mutual TLS (OTLP/HTTP, client
    certificate from the install CA); `edge-gateway` to `ingest-api` over mutual TLS (TLS 1.2
    floor, client certificate required; `carto_core.ingest.server`); core to edge through
    `/internal/tokenize` and `/internal/reveal`, which accept only Ed25519-signed internal
    assertions (audience, permission, purpose, nonce, at most 5 minutes; plan decision 13;
    `carto_edge.reveal`). The core signer that calls them is M3. Bundles cross from the
    customer to us as files: integrity by signature, origin by hand-over (ADR 0022).
  - *Threats and mitigations that landed:* SSRF through connector hosts: resolution, rejection of
    loopback, link-local, metadata and unlisted private ranges, and address pinning for HTTP,
    PostgreSQL and SFTP (ADR 0018, `carto_edge.net.ssrf`); DNS rebinding: a name with any refused
    address is refused and the validated address is the one connected to; zip bombs and oversized
    inputs: the spec 8.1.1 archive limits, streamed bounded readers and per-record caps
    (`carto_edge.connectors.upload`, `carto_edge.pipeline.parser`), the webhook 1 MB body cap and
    depth limit (`carto_edge.connectors.webhook`), the OTLP decompressed-size cap
    (`carto_edge.gateway.otlp`), the `ingest-api` wire and decompressed caps
    (`carto_core.ingest.app`) and the bundle loader's manifest and line caps
    (`carto_core.bundle`); assertion replay: single use per nonce plus the 5-minute lifetime
    (`carto_edge.reveal`); write-capable credentials: the SQL grant checks and the Splunk
    capability check report `WRITE_CAPABLE`, and the gateway's scheduler runs every pull
    connector's test before polling and never polls a source that cannot be enabled
    (`carto_edge.gateway.scheduler`; `carto-edge source test` runs it on demand), read-only
    sessions and the single-SELECT statement check (`carto_edge.connectors.sql_dialects`), SFTP
    list and stat only; log leakage: the redaction processor on every output path
    (`carto_common.logging`, ADR 0010), the HTTP client loggers held at WARNING because their INFO
    lines carry URLs, the gateway's own access line with route templates instead of raw paths, and
    the leak test over bundle, forwarded batches, product logs and ClickHouse rows (see
    `edge/tests/test_edge_leak.py`, `make leak`, and the CI `compose` job, which replays the
    simulator through the stack and scans ClickHouse and the service logs); low-cardinality
    identifiers (batch keys) kept in clear by spec 8.3 rule 6 unless pinned: pinned in the scenario
    configs, flagged in the install guides, default safeguard open for the founder (ADR 0026); push
    acknowledgement before durability: the push routes seal their events into the disk buffer
    before answering 2xx and answer 503 when the buffer refused them (`carto_edge.gateway.app`);
    key extraction: keys exist at rest only wrapped
    by the KMS, never in environment variables, images or logs, and `carto-ctl key init` prints
    fingerprints only (`carto_edge.keys`, `carto_ctl.keyinit`); buffer exhaustion: the 20 GiB cap
    and the 80% backpressure threshold (`carto_edge.pipeline.buffer`), mapped to 429 and 503 on
    the push routes (see `carto_edge.gateway.app`); bundle tampering: signature and per-file
    digests verified before any event is read, extra files refused (`carto_core.bundle`).
  - *Residual risks and deferrals:* the SQL Server connector is tested against a fake
    connection, not a live server (ADR 0019), and the edge image lacks the ODBC driver; the leak
    run over scenario B waits for scenario B in M4 (ADR 0011); cloud KMS and cloud secret
    managers arrive in M6 (ADR 0012, 0013); the Compose stack talks to PostgreSQL and ClickHouse
    without TLS and with one database user on the internal network until M6; the OTLP endpoint has
    no per-source quota or rate limit, only body caps and backpressure (spec 15 row 10 is partly
    met); with the local KMS the master key sits in the same volume as the keys it wraps, so the
    protection is the volume and disk encryption (Vault Transit for production); the nonce cache
    and the reveal rate-limit windows are in memory and reset on a gateway restart (see
    `carto_edge.reveal`); MySQL and SQL Server connect by name after validation, leaving a
    rebinding window (ADR 0018); `ingest-api` and the gateway authorise any certificate from the
    install CA rather than a named service, and the Compose `pki` volume exposes every service
    key to the three services that mount it (the CA key is on its own volume); webhook replay protection depends on
    the sender's timestamp header; the Vault address is an operator setting and does not pass the
    SSRF policy (`carto_edge.secrets`); certificate rotation is manual until M6; the edge
    pipeline measured about 1,800 events/s in one process on a development laptop, under the spec
    17 target of 2,000 (plan M1 demo note; the reference node figure is the founder's).
  - *Spec 15 rows touched:* 1 (secret references, read-only verification), 2 (tokenized events,
    leak test), 3 and 8 (edge side: tokenize and reveal rate limits, assertions and audit; core
    side M3), 6 (SSRF suite), 7 (archive limits, `defusedxml`, RE2), 9 (first service images,
    Trivy image scan), 10 (buffer caps and backpressure), 13 (read-only connectors), 15 (wrapped
    key files, backup guidance in `docs/install/compose-pilot.md`; restore drill M6).
