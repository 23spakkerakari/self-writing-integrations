# ADR 0058: Decisions found while wiring the M2 packages together

Status: accepted, 2026-10-18 (plan `docs/plans/M2.md`, review pass; spec 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 12,
14.2, 14.9)

The work packages of M2 were built in parallel against the wave 0 seams. Connecting them
settled a handful of questions the plan and the earlier ADRs left open. Each is small; they are
recorded together so the reviewer finds them in one place.

## 1. A human decision produces one audit row, written by the route

The linker's `ReviewService` and the console route both know how to audit a decision. The route
holds the request id, the client address and the user agent, which spec 14.9 wants in the row
and the service never receives. The API's `LinkPortAdapter` therefore gives its `ReviewService`
a no-op recorder and the route writes the row; transitions the linker makes on its own
(auto-accept, stale, recover, re-propose) are audited by the worker's `PostgresAuditLog`.
Proposals are engine output, not decisions, and are not audited. A test asserts exactly one
row per decision.

## 2. ETags of systems and entities derive from `updated_at`

`systems` and `entities` carry no version column; their `ETag` is `updated_at` in epoch
milliseconds and `PATCH` compares it inside the `UPDATE`. Two writes within one millisecond
would share a version; a version column in a later migration makes it exact. `key_links` has a
real `version` that every decision bumps.

## 3. Bridges are verified from co-occurrence, not from the token join

A bridge pairs two different identifiers of one event, so the token join of spec 9.3 is empty by
construction and the `n_match < 20` filter would discard every bridge. Bridge features come from
the `CooccurrenceRow`: `n_match` is the number of co-occurring events, `c_ab`/`c_ba` the share of
each end's distinct values seen together, `pairing_consistency` the functional-dependency share
of spec 9.4; the role is `transaction` when both directions are near one-to-one, the score is
`max(logistic, consistency)` for a transaction bridge at or above `bridge_consistency_min` and
`min(logistic, consistency)` otherwise.

## 4. Composite matching re-estimates `u` within the blocked pairs and constrains `m >= u`

With `u` held at the random-pair estimate, date-blocked near misses received a match-sized
boost on the date component and EM collapsed to "everything matches". The posterior that picks
the threshold uses `u` re-estimated within the blocks; the stored rule and the pair weights keep
the random-pair `u` as spec 9.5 words it, so M3 re-applies the same threshold. A component whose
`m` would fall below `u` is clamped, so disagreement never counts in favour of a match. The spec
9.3 `min_match` filter applies to composite rules too.

## 5. Composite matching also runs beside a partial exact link

Spec 9.5 tries composite matching "when no exact link scores above 0.5". Scenario C's HRIS
carries the candidate id in 60% of rows and the rest is keyed by hand, so an exact link exists
and covers too little. `LinkerSettings.composite_coverage_floor` (0.8) adds the second trigger:
the best exact or bridge link covers less than that share of the later end. A strong exact link
with high coverage still suppresses composite matching for that pair (scenario C's HRIS to
payroll link C06 at 98% hides the composite C08), which bounds composite recall on that
scenario; whether composite matching should also run beside strong links is a founder question
for M3.

## 6. Dates from day-first exports

The edge's slashed-date parser reads `a/b/yyyy` month-first unless `a > 12` (scenario C's
legacy onboarding system writes `%d/%m/%Y`), so date tokens of days 1 to 12 disagree across
systems. Left as a known hazard for the gate and recorded here; a per-source date-order hint is
an edge change for M3.

## 7. Windows are day-aligned

The profiler reads `[start of (today - window_days + 1), start of (today + 2))` rather than
`[now - window_days, now + 1 day)`, so day sketches cover whole days and a full pass equals the
incremental passes (a property test holds it). The linker uses the same window.

## Consequences

- The reviewer reads one audit row per decision and finds linker-made transitions under the
  actor `linker`.
- `make eval` reports composite recall against the trigger of item 5; the M3 plan picks up the
  founder question and the date-order hint.
